## Overview

As a university student, have you ever try to keep track of your grades?
Imagine having a simple tool to check what is your real grade in a course.

For months I used a spreadsheet to map that evaluation weight to fit just the grades I had already received, and I had to copy the formulas to fit another course (which might have not had the same number of evaluations or even the same type of evaluation).

This application solves that problem through a simple and user-friendly interface. It was created to calculate:

- [GPA](#G)
- Yearly [GPA](#G)
- [TGPA](#T)
- Courses' grades
- What grade is needed to pass a course
- What grade is needed to get a desired GPA

## Interface Description

The main page is divided in 2 parts.

### Grade display

On the left, there is a giant display of the grade you are looking to calculate. By default, it displays your GPA, but it will display the grade of the [evaluation division](#E) you have clicked on.

### Evaluation display

On the right, you have all your evaluation periods organized in a hierarchical manner. At the very top, you will have a tab display showing all your school years. Immediately below, you will find your terms for each year organized in tabs. Lastly, the major part of the screen will show each of the courses you took during each term with all its corresponding assignments, quizzes, exams and other evaluations.
